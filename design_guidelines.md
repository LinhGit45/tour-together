# TourTogether Design Guidelines

## Design Approach: Productivity-Inspired Minimalism

**Selected Approach**: Design System (Apple HIG + Linear-inspired aesthetics)  
**Rationale**: As a utility-focused trip planning tool, the app prioritizes clarity, organization, and ease of use. Drawing from Linear's clean typography and Apple's content-first philosophy ensures the interface stays out of the way while making itinerary creation and sharing effortless.

**Core Principles**:
- Information clarity over decoration
- Generous whitespace for breathing room
- Card-based organization for clear content separation
- Immediate visual hierarchy through typography
